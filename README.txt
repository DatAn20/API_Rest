#REST API
    REST is a robust API architecture


#CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)
    CRUD's origins are in Database records. By Definition, CRUD is more of a cycle than an architecture system.
    - CREAT procedures generate new records via INSERT statements.
    - READ procedures reads the data based on input parameters. Similarly, RETRIEVE procedures grab records based on input parameters.
    - UPDATE procedures modify records without overwriting them.
    - DELETE procedures delete where specified.
